== What's Snakefarm?

Snakefarm is a game, it was written by four of us: Adam Banko
(documentation jedi), Peter Gerencser (UML maniac), Gergely Kis (design
and testsuite mastah), Miklos Vajna (coding monkey).

Contacts are available in the PDF (see below).

== Status

It has a loooooong Hungarian documentation which is available
http://spqr-lab.sch.bme.hu/system/files/teljes.pdf[here] or
https://github.com/downloads/vmiklos/snakefarm/teljes.pdf[here] (local mirror).

The original project page was http://spqr-lab.sch.bme.hu/[here].
The big PDF is browsable there on individual HTML pages, if you are
interested.
